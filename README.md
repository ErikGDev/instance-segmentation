This is a fork of [Facebook AI Research's](https://github.com/facebookresearch) implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), Detectron2. Detectron2 is a complete write-up from its previous version
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/). This Mask R-CNN implementation is powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and is based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

In this project, real-time video and depth values from a [Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ D435 camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) are inputted into Detectron2's Mask R-CNN model. The output is the same real-time video (3-6fps) with instance segmentation masks and labels superimposed. The median depth values of each object are also outputted.

## Accuracy and Specifications of Model

**Segmentation Validation Results**

|  | Backbone | AP | AP<sub>50</sub> | AP<sub>75</sub> | AP<sub>S</sub> | AP<sub>M</sub> | AP<sub>L</sub> |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Original Mask R-CNN   | ResNet-101-FPN  | 35.7 | 58.0 | 37.8 | 15.5 | 38.1 | 52.4 |
| Matterport Mask R-CNN | ReSNet-101-FPN | 38.0 | 55.8 | <b>41.3</b> | 17.9 | <b>45.5</b> | <b>55.9</b> |
| Detectron2 Mask R-CNN | ReSNet-101-FPN | <b>38.6</b> | <b>60.4</b> | <b>41.3</b> | <b>19.5</b> | 41.3 | 55.3 |

Validation tests were perfomed on the segmentation masks created on the 2017 COCO validation dataset. The standard COCO validation metrics include average AP over IoU thresholds, AP<sub>50</sub>, AP<sub>75</sub>, and AP<sub>S</sub>, AP<sub>M</sub> and AP<sub>L</sub> (AP at different scales). These results were then compared to COCO validation results from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) and a popular [Mask R-CNN implementation by Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). Clearly, Detectron2's Mask R-CNN outperforms the original Mask R-CNN and Matterport's Mask R-CNN with respect to average precision. It also outperformed state-of-the art COCO segmentation competition winners from the [2015 and 2016 challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard). The reason the competition winners from 2017 and 2018 were not chosen, was to avoid overfitting. Furthermore these models trade a slower inference time for a higher accuracy.

**Why this model?**

Detectron2's Mask R-CNN with a ReSNet-101-FPN backbone was determined to be the optimal model. Upon comparing Detectron2 to [MMDetection's models](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md), which won first place in the [2018 segmentation COCO challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard), it is evident that the choice of model is appropriate for high-speed real-time video. 

When comparing [Detectron2's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md#coco-instance-segmentation-baselines-with-mask-r-cnn) to [MMDetection's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#mask-r-cnn), Detectron2 outperforms in both mask AP (38.6 vs 35.9) and inference time (0.070 s/im vs 0.105 s/im). MMDetectron does have models that are slightly more accurate than Detectron2's Mask R-CNN implementation, such as [the Hybrid Task Cascade model (HTC)](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#hybrid-task-cascade-htc) however these often result in models that output masks at less than 4 fps. When adding the time to ouput the superimposed images, this would be insufficient for real-time.

Detectron2's Model Zoo displays the inference time and Mask AP for each model provided. For the Mask R-CNN models, the FPN model with a ResNet101 backbone has the best Mask AP for the short time it takes for inferences.

**Config Settings**

Config settings can be altered under the create_predictor function. To see default config settings and descriptions of each setting, refer to detectron2/defaults.py.

The cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST line specifies the lower threshold for when the instance segmentation mask is shown to the user. For example, set cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = 0.7. If Detectron2 is at least 70% confident the object detected belongs to a class name, the mask is superimposed onto the image.

The cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS line specifies the pretrained weights used to perform instance segmentation. This program uses the ResNet101 FPN weights.

The cfg.INPUT.MIN_SIZE_TEST line specifies the size of the smallest size of the image during testing/inference. If this is set to zero, resizing is disabled. 

## Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ D435 Camera

According to Intel's paper, [Best-Known-Methods for Tuning Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ D400 Depth Cameras for Best Performance](https://www.intelrealsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BKMs_Tuning_RealSense_D4xx_Cam.pdf), The depth RMS (root mean square) error increases rapidly when placing objects further away, especially when the distance is greater than 3m. The orange line on the graph below represents the depth RMS error on a D435 with HFOV=90deg, Xres=848, baseline=50mm and for subpixel=0.08.

<img src="images/d435_rms_error.png" />

**Depth Error Testing**

Testing was performed on this program, where the real distances of objects from the D435 were compared to the distance measured by the stereo sensors on the D435. The true distance was found by measuring the distance between a box (with a flat front) and the parallel plane of the imagers.

<img src="images/depth_vs_range.png" />

from [Intel D400 Datasheet](https://www.mouser.ca/pdfdocs/Intel_D400_Series_Datasheet.pdf)

The D435 recordings were measured on the [realsense-viewer](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/tools/realsense-viewer) program. The stereo resolution was set to 1280 x 720. Rather than the depth RMS error, the absolute depth error was compared to the real distance of the object to the D435.

<img src="Screenshot_38.png" />
<img src="Screenshot_37.png" />

This graph shows that the absolute error appears to exponentially increases when the distance increases. This means the depth recordings will be most accurate when the object is closer to the camera.

**When does the Object Record 0m?**

When the object is too close to the camera, the depth values will return 0m. This threshold is known as MinZ. The formula for calculating MinZ is

MinZ(mm) = focal length(pixels)ùíô Baseline(mm)/126

Therefore with a depth resolution of 848x480, the MinZ is ~16.8cm. If the object is within this distance, no value is returned.

Similar to MinZ, MaxZ exists too. For the D435, the MaxZ is [approximately 10m](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/128255/intel-realsense-depth-camera-d435.html). Any object outside this range will also be recorded as 0m.

Sometimes objects can be recorded as 0m even though they are inside the MinZ and MaxZ threshold. This usually occurs when there is too much noise on the depth image. This can occur when the target is not well textured. For more information on how to configure the D435 for specific environments and objects, refer to [this paper](https://www.intelrealsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BKMs_Tuning_RealSense_D4xx_Cam.pdf).

**How is each Depth Value Calculated?**

To find the distance of each object, the median depth pixel is used. All pixels associated to the object are abstracted to a histogram with a max distance of 10m (Max range of the D435), and 500 bins. The bins are looped through until the bin which contains the median is found. This means that the depth values will change with intervals of 0.02m.

For smaller intervals of 0.01m, change the NUM_BINS constant to 1000, and change 

```centre_depth = "{:.2f}m".format(x / 50)```
to
```centre_depth = "{:.2f}m".format(x / 100)```

## Object Tracking

The purpose of this project is to propose where objects exists in the environment around a robot. In addition to this, it would be ideal to understand the movement of each object. 

**Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT)**

The velocity, linear speed (between camera and object), and time to impact were all calculated using an altered version of [Chris Fotache's implementation of SORT with PyTorch](https://github.com/cfotache/pytorch_objectdetecttrack), created by [Alex Bewley](https://github.com/abewley/), Zongyuan Ge, Lionel Ott, Fabio Ramos and Ben Upcroft.

Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763</br>
Original python implementation of SORT by Alex Bewley: https://github.com/abewley/sort

SORT proposes using a Kalman filter to predict the trajectory of previously identified objects, and then match them with newly identified objects. In this program, when an object is matched with a detection, the real-world position and distance from camera are added as attributes to the KalmanBoxTracker object. When the same object is tracked to the next frame, linear speed, velocity, real-world distance, and time until impact are all added under the same object. Each KalmanBoxTracker is added to the appropriate DetectedObject as the attribute DetectredObject.track. This means all the data can be passed to an API using a single DetectedObject.

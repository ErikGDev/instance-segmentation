This is a fork of [Facebook AI Research's](https://github.com/facebookresearch) implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), Detectron2. Detectron2 is a complete write-up from its previous version
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/). This Mask R-CNN implementation is powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and is based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.

In this project, real-time video and depth values from a [Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ D435 camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) are inputted into Detectron2's Mask R-CNN model. The output is the same real-time video (4-7fps) with instance segmentation masks and labels superimposed. The depth values of the centre of each object are also outputted.

## Usage

**Installation**

For the installation of Detectron2, please refer to the [official Detectron2 GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

**After Installation**

Copy and paste main.py from this directory into your new Detectron2 directory. To perform instance segmentation straight from a D435 camera attached to a USB port, access the Detectron2 directory and type 'python3 main.py'. If using .bag files, type 'python3 main.py --file={filename}' where {filename} is the name of the input .bag file. To create .bag files, use d435_to_file.py in the tools folder.

## Accuracy and Specifications of Model

**Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ D435 Camera**

The depth value uncertaincy for the D435 camera is less than one percent of the distance from the object. If the camera is 1 metre from the object, the expected uncertainty is between 2.5mm and 5mm.
When the object is too close to the camera, the depth values will return 0mm. This threshold is known as MinZ. The formula for calculating MinZ is

MinZ(mm) = focal length(pixels)ùíô Baseline(mm)/126

Therefore with a depth resolution of 848x480, the MinZ is ~16.8cm. If the object is within this distance, no value is returned.

**Segmentation Validation Results**

|  | Backbone | AP | AP<sub>50</sub> | AP<sub>75</sub> | AP<sub>S</sub> | AP<sub>M</sub> | AP<sub>L</sub> |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| Original Mask R-CNN   | ResNet-101-FPN  | 35.7 | 58.0 | 37.8 | 15.5 | 38.1 | 52.4 |
| Matterport Mask R-CNN | ReSNet-101-FPN | 38.0 | 55.8 | <b>41.3</b> | 17.9 | <b>45.5</b> | <b>55.9</b> |
| Detectron2 Mask R-CNN | ReSNet-101-FPN | <b>38.6</b> | <b>60.4</b> | <b>41.3</b> | <b>19.5</b> | 41.3 | 55.3 |

I performed validation tests on the segmentation masks created on the 2017 COCO validation dataset. The standard COCO validation metrics include average AP over IoU thresholds, AP<sub>50</sub>, AP<sub>75</sub>, and AP<sub>S</sub>, AP<sub>M</sub> and AP<sub>L</sub> (AP at different scales). These results were then compared to COCO validation results from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) and a popular [Mask R-CNN implementation by Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). Clearly, Detectron2's Mask R-CNN outperforms the original Mask R-CNN and Matterport's Mask R-CNN with respect to average precision. It also outperformed state-of-the art COCO segmentation competition winners from the 2015 and 2016 challenge. The reason I chose not to use the models of competition winners from 2017 and 2018 is to avoid overfitting. Furthermore these models trade inference time for a higher accuracy.

**Why this model?**

I decided to use Detectron2's Mask R-CNN with a ReSNet-101-FPN backbone. Upon comparing Detectron2 to [MMDetection's models](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md) which won first place in the [2018 segmentation COCO challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard), it is evident that my choice of model is the correct choice for high-speed real-time video. 

When comparing [Detectron2's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md#coco-instance-segmentation-baselines-with-mask-r-cnn) to [MMDetection's Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#mask-r-cnn), Detectron2 outperforms in both mask AP (38.6 vs 35.9) and inference time (0.070 s/im vs 0.105 s/im). MMDetectron does have models that are slightly more accurate than Detectron2's Mask R-CNN implementation, such as [the Hybrid Task Cascade model (HTC)](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#hybrid-task-cascade-htc) however these often result in models that output masks at less than 4 fps. When adding the time to ouput the superimposed images, this would be insufficient for real-time.
